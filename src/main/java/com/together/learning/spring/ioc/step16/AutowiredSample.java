/**
 * 	The autowire-candidate attribute is designed to only affect
 * 	type-based autowiring. It does not affect explicit references
 * 	by name, which get resolved even if the specified bean is not
 * 	marked as an autowire candidate. As a consequence,autowiring by
 * 	name nevertheless injects a bean if the name matches.

 You can also limit autowire candidates based on pattern-matching
 against bean names. The top-level <beans/> element accepts one or more
 patterns within its default-autowire-candidates attribute. For example,
 to limit autowire candidate status to any bean whose name ends with Repository,
 provide a value of *Repository. To provide multiple patterns,
 define them in a comma-separated list. An explicit value of true or false for
 a bean definitionâ€™s autowire-candidate attribute always takes precedence
